%% ==============================

The damage assessment of plates on which an object has fallen or an impact has been made is an important task in the industry. However, in most work, only the effects of an impact on a plate in the middle of the plate are analysed. However, the position of the impact on the plate is closely related to the damage assessment. In the following, a parameter study is carried out which combines effects such as position, weight, speed and panel properties. First, it is determined under which conditions the calculations are valid and reliable. Then the actual parameter study is carried out using a program that uses the mathematical principles described above.
